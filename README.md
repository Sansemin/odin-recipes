# Odin-Recipes

In this project I learned:
    
- Creating a basic page using HTML
- Using the correct tag for linking images ;)
- Using absolute and relative links, although, only therelative links remaine
- Creating different lists
- Improving my knowledge of vs code shortcuts
    - In particular: Select until end of line and block selection
- Got more used to using git(hub)
